# WorldBank

A wrapper for the World Bank's Development Indicators API sponsored by Code for America.

Please see the World Bank's data [[developer's page](http://data.worldbank.org/developers/)] for more info on the data sources.

The World Bank gem should work with out problem on MRI 1.9.2, REE or
JRuby. If it doesn't, it's a bug, and we'd appreciate it if you filed an
issue!
